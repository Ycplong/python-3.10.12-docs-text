自定义 Python 解释器
********************

The modules described in this chapter allow writing interfaces similar
to Python's interactive interpreter.  If you want a Python interpreter
that supports some special feature in addition to the Python language,
you should look at the "code" module.  (The "codeop" module is lower-
level, used to support compiling a possibly incomplete chunk of Python
code.)

本章描述的完整模块列表如下：

* "code" --- 解释器基类

  * 交互解释器对象

  * 交互式控制台对象

* "codeop" --- 编译Python代码
