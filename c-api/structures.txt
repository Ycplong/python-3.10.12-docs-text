公用对象的结构
**************

大量的结构体被用于定义Python的对象类型。这一节描述了这些的结构体和它们
的使用方法。


基本的对象类型和宏
==================

所有的 Python 对象都在对象的内存表示的开始部分共享少量的字段。 这些字
段用 "PyObject" 或 "PyVarObject" 类型来表示，这些类型又由一些宏定义，
这些宏也直接或间接地用于所有其他 Python 对象的定义。

type PyObject
    * Part of the Limited API. (Only some members are part of the
   stable ABI.)*

   All object types are extensions of this type.  This is a type which
   contains the information Python needs to treat a pointer to an
   object as an object.  In a normal "release" build, it contains only
   the object's reference count and a pointer to the corresponding
   type object. Nothing is actually declared to be a "PyObject", but
   every pointer to a Python object can be cast to a "PyObject*".
   Access to the members must be done by using the macros "Py_REFCNT"
   and "Py_TYPE".

type PyVarObject
    * Part of the Limited API. (Only some members are part of the
   stable ABI.)*

   This is an extension of "PyObject" that adds the "ob_size" field.
   This is only used for objects that have some notion of *length*.
   This type does not often appear in the Python/C API. Access to the
   members must be done by using the macros "Py_REFCNT", "Py_TYPE",
   and "Py_SIZE".

PyObject_HEAD

   This is a macro used when declaring new types which represent
   objects without a varying length.  The PyObject_HEAD macro expands
   to:

      PyObject ob_base;

   See documentation of "PyObject" above.

PyObject_VAR_HEAD

   This is a macro used when declaring new types which represent
   objects with a length that varies from instance to instance. The
   PyObject_VAR_HEAD macro expands to:

      PyVarObject ob_base;

   参见上面 "PyVarObject" 的文档。

int Py_Is(const PyObject *x, const PyObject *y)
    * Part of the Stable ABI since version 3.10.*

   测试 *x* 是否为 *y* 对象，与 Python 中的 "x is y" 相同。

int Py_IsNone(const PyObject *x)
    * Part of the Stable ABI since version 3.10.*

   测试一个对象是否为 "None" 单例，与 Python 中的 "x is None" 相同。

   3.10 新版功能.

int Py_IsTrue(const PyObject *x)
    * Part of the Stable ABI since version 3.10.*

   测试一个对象是否为 "True" 单例，与 Python 中的 "x is True" 相同。

   获取 Python 对象 *o* 的类型。

   返回一个 *borrowed reference*。

   Use the "Py_SET_TYPE()" function to set an object type.

int Py_IS_TYPE(PyObject *o, PyTypeObject *type)

   Return non-zero if the object *o* type is *type*. Return zero
   otherwise. Equivalent to: "Py_TYPE(o) == type".

   3.9 新版功能.

void Py_SET_TYPE(PyObject *o, PyTypeObject *type)

   Set the object *o* type to *type*.

   3.9 新版功能.

Py_ssize_t Py_REFCNT(const PyObject *o)

   Get the reference count of the Python object *o*.

   在 3.10 版更改: "Py_REFCNT()" is changed to the inline static
   function. Use "Py_SET_REFCNT()" to set an object reference count.

void Py_SET_REFCNT(PyObject *o, Py_ssize_t refcnt)

   Set the object *o* reference counter to *refcnt*.

   3.9 新版功能.

Py_ssize_t Py_SIZE(const PyVarObject *o)

   Get the size of the Python object *o*.

   Use the "Py_SET_SIZE()" function to set an object size.

void Py_SET_SIZE(PyVarObject *o, Py_ssize_t size)

   Set the object *o* size to *size*.

PyObject_HEAD_INIT(type)

   This is a macro which expands to initialization values for a new
   "PyObject" type.  This macro expands to:

      _PyObject_EXTRA_INIT
      1, type,

PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT(type, size)

   This is a macro which expands to initialization values for a new
   "PyVarObject" type, including the "ob_size" field. This macro
   expands to:

      _PyObject_EXTRA_INIT
      1, type, size,


Implementing functions and methods
==================================

type PyCFunction
    * Part of the Stable ABI.*

   Type of the functions used to implement most Python callables in C.
   Functions of this type take two "PyObject*" parameters and return
   one such value.  If the return value is "NULL", an exception shall
   have been set.  If not "NULL", the return value is interpreted as
   the return value of the function as exposed in Python.  The
   function must return a new reference.

   The function signature is:

      PyObject *PyCFunction(PyObject *self,
                            PyObject *args);

type PyCFunctionWithKeywords
    * Part of the Stable ABI.*

   Type of the functions used to implement Python callables in C with
   signature "METH_VARARGS | METH_KEYWORDS". The function signature
   is:

      PyObject *PyCFunctionWithKeywords(PyObject *self,
                                        PyObject *args,
                                        PyObject *kwargs);

type _PyCFunctionFast

   Type of the functions used to implement Python callables in C with
   signature "METH_FASTCALL". The function signature is:

      PyObject *_PyCFunctionFast(PyObject *self,
                                 PyObject *const *args,
                                 Py_ssize_t nargs);

type _PyCFunctionFastWithKeywords

   Type of the functions used to implement Python callables in C with
   signature "METH_FASTCALL | METH_KEYWORDS". The function signature
   is:

      PyObject *_PyCFunctionFastWithKeywords(PyObject *self,
                                             PyObject *const *args,
                                             Py_ssize_t nargs,
                                             PyObject *kwnames);

type PyCMethod

   Type of the functions used to implement Python callables in C with
   signature "METH_METHOD | METH_FASTCALL | METH_KEYWORDS". The
   function signature is:

      PyObject *PyCMethod(PyObject *self,
                          PyTypeObject *defining_class,
                          PyObject *const *args,
                          Py_ssize_t nargs,
                          PyObject *kwnames)

type PyMethodDef
    * Part of the Stable ABI (including all members).*

   Structure used to describe a method of an extension type.  This
   structure has four fields:

   const char *ml_name

      name of the method

   PyCFunction ml_meth

      pointer to the C implementation

   int ml_flags

      flags bits indicating how the call should be constructed

   const char *ml_doc

      points to the contents of the docstring

The "ml_meth" is a C function pointer.  The functions may be of
different types, but they always return "PyObject*".  If the function
is not of the "PyCFunction", the compiler will require a cast in the
method table. Even though "PyCFunction" defines the first parameter as
"PyObject*", it is common that the method implementation uses the
specific C type of the *self* object.

The "ml_flags" field is a bitfield which can include the following
flags. The individual flags indicate either a calling convention or a
binding convention.

There are these calling conventions:

METH_VARARGS

   This is the typical calling convention, where the methods have the
   type "PyCFunction". The function expects two "PyObject*" values.
   The first one is the *self* object for methods; for module
   functions, it is the module object.  The second parameter (often
   called *args*) is a tuple object representing all arguments. This
   parameter is typically processed using "PyArg_ParseTuple()" or
   "PyArg_UnpackTuple()".

METH_VARARGS | METH_KEYWORDS

   Methods with these flags must be of type "PyCFunctionWithKeywords".
   The function expects three parameters: *self*, *args*, *kwargs*
   where *kwargs* is a dictionary of all the keyword arguments or
   possibly "NULL" if there are no keyword arguments.  The parameters
   are typically processed using "PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords()".

METH_FASTCALL

   Fast calling convention supporting only positional arguments. The
   methods have the type "_PyCFunctionFast". The first parameter is
   *self*, the second parameter is a C array of "PyObject*" values
   indicating the arguments and the third parameter is the number of
   arguments (the length of the array).

   3.7 新版功能.

   在 3.10 版更改: "METH_FASTCALL" is now part of the stable ABI.

METH_FASTCALL | METH_KEYWORDS

   Extension of "METH_FASTCALL" supporting also keyword arguments,
   with methods of type "_PyCFunctionFastWithKeywords". Keyword
   arguments are passed the same way as in the vectorcall protocol:
   there is an additional fourth "PyObject*" parameter which is a
   tuple representing the names of the keyword arguments (which are
   guaranteed to be strings) or possibly "NULL" if there are no
   keywords.  The values of the keyword arguments are stored in the
   *args* array, after the positional arguments.

   3.7 新版功能.

METH_METHOD | METH_FASTCALL | METH_KEYWORDS

   Extension of "METH_FASTCALL | METH_KEYWORDS" supporting the
   *defining class*, that is, the class that contains the method in
   question. The defining class might be a superclass of
   "Py_TYPE(self)".

   The method needs to be of type "PyCMethod", the same as for
   "METH_FASTCALL | METH_KEYWORDS" with "defining_class" argument
   added after "self".

   3.9 新版功能.

METH_NOARGS

   Methods without parameters don't need to check whether arguments
   are given if they are listed with the "METH_NOARGS" flag.  They
   need to be of type "PyCFunction".  The first parameter is typically
   named *self* and will hold a reference to the module or object
   instance.  In all cases the second parameter will be "NULL".

METH_O

   Methods with a single object argument can be listed with the
   "METH_O" flag, instead of invoking "PyArg_ParseTuple()" with a
   ""O"" argument. They have the type "PyCFunction", with the *self*
   parameter, and a "PyObject*" parameter representing the single
   argument.

These two constants are not used to indicate the calling convention
but the binding when use with methods of classes.  These may not be
used for functions defined for modules.  At most one of these flags
may be set for any given method.

METH_CLASS

   The method will be passed the type object as the first parameter
   rather than an instance of the type.  This is used to create *class
   methods*, similar to what is created when using the "classmethod()"
   built-in function.

METH_STATIC

   The method will be passed "NULL" as the first parameter rather than
   an instance of the type.  This is used to create *static methods*,
   similar to what is created when using the "staticmethod()" built-in
   function.

One other constant controls whether a method is loaded in place of
another definition with the same method name.

METH_COEXIST

   The method will be loaded in place of existing definitions.
   Without *METH_COEXIST*, the default is to skip repeated
   definitions.  Since slot wrappers are loaded before the method
   table, the existence of a *sq_contains* slot, for example, would
   generate a wrapped method named "__contains__()" and preclude the
   loading of a corresponding PyCFunction with the same name.  With
   the flag defined, the PyCFunction will be loaded in place of the
   wrapper object and will co-exist with the slot.  This is helpful
   because calls to PyCFunctions are optimized more than wrapper
   object calls.


Accessing attributes of extension types
=======================================

type PyMemberDef
    * Part of the Stable ABI (including all members).*

   Structure which describes an attribute of a type which corresponds
   to a C struct member.  Its fields are:

   |                    |                 | field should be read-only or    |
   |                    |                 | writable                        |
   +--------------------+-----------------+---------------------------------+
   | "doc"              | const char *    | points to the contents of the   |
   |                    |                 | docstring                       |
   +--------------------+-----------------+---------------------------------+

   "type" can be one of many "T_" macros corresponding to various C
   types.  When the member is accessed in Python, it will be converted
   to the equivalent Python type.

   +-----------------+--------------------+
   | Macro name      | C 类型             |

   "T_OBJECT" and "T_OBJECT_EX" differ in that "T_OBJECT" returns
   "None" if the member is "NULL" and "T_OBJECT_EX" raises an
   "AttributeError".  Try to use "T_OBJECT_EX" over "T_OBJECT" because
   "T_OBJECT_EX" handles use of the "del" statement on that attribute
   more correctly than "T_OBJECT".

   "flags" can be "0" for write and read access or "READONLY" for
   read-only access.  Using "T_STRING" for "type" implies "READONLY".
   "T_STRING" data is interpreted as UTF-8. Only "T_OBJECT" and
   "T_OBJECT_EX" members can be deleted.  (They are set to "NULL").

   Heap allocated types (created using "PyType_FromSpec()" or
   similar), "PyMemberDef" may contain definitions for the special
   members "__dictoffset__", "__weaklistoffset__" and
   "__vectorcalloffset__", corresponding to "tp_dictoffset",
   "tp_weaklistoffset" and "tp_vectorcall_offset" in type objects.
   These must be defined with "T_PYSSIZET" and "READONLY", for
   example:

      static PyMemberDef spam_type_members[] = {
          {"__dictoffset__", T_PYSSIZET, offsetof(Spam_object, dict), READONLY},
          {NULL}  /* Sentinel */
      };

PyObject *PyMember_GetOne(const char *obj_addr, struct PyMemberDef *m)

   Get an attribute belonging to the object at address *obj_addr*.
   The attribute is described by "PyMemberDef" *m*.  Returns "NULL" on
   error.

int PyMember_SetOne(char *obj_addr, struct PyMemberDef *m, PyObject *o)

   Set an attribute belonging to the object at address *obj_addr* to
   object *o*. The attribute to set is described by "PyMemberDef" *m*.
   Returns "0" if successful and a negative value on failure.

type PyGetSetDef
    * Part of the Stable ABI (including all members).*

   Structure to define property-like access for a type. See also
   description of the "PyTypeObject.tp_getset" slot.

   The "get" function takes one "PyObject*" parameter (the instance)
   and a function pointer (the associated "closure"):

      typedef PyObject *(*getter)(PyObject *, void *);

   It should return a new reference on success or "NULL" with a set
   exception on failure.

   "set" functions take two "PyObject*" parameters (the instance and
   the value to be set) and a function pointer (the associated
   "closure"):

      typedef int (*setter)(PyObject *, PyObject *, void *);

   In case the attribute should be deleted the second parameter is
   "NULL". Should return "0" on success or "-1" with a set exception
   on failure.
